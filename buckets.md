# User Feedback Analysis: Splitwise Reviews

Based on an analysis of user reviews, the feedback has been categorized into five major themes. These themes highlight the stark contrast between the app's core utility (which users loved) and the recent monetization strategies (which users overwhelmingly hate).

## 1. The "Daily Limit" Dealbreaker
**Explanation:** The most frequent and intense complaint is the restriction of adding only 3-4 expenses per day on the free tier. This completely breaks the workflow for two primary user groups: travelers (who have dozens of daily expenses) and roommates (who "batch" enter expenses once a month).

**Excerpts:**
> "Latest update makes the free version non-functional unless you only have 3 expenses per day. I set up a new group for a recent weekend trip... The free version is essentially useless."

> "I usually load all my expenses at the end of the month. this change coming in without any warning or notification on the app is really infuriating! now you can add just 3 expenses per day!"

> "On the free version, you can only add a very small number of expenses per day before being forced to pay for Pro or wait another 24 hours. This arbitrary limit made it very frustrating to use on a group trip."

## 2. Aggressive Monetization (The 10-Second Wait)
**Explanation:** Users describe the new "wait timer" before adding an expense not as a standard ad, but as a "punishment" or "dark pattern." It is an unskippable 10-second delay designed specifically to degrade the user experience and coerce a subscription.

**Excerpts:**
> "They also make you wait a 10 second timer before adding each expense unless you have 'Pro'. This isn't how it was before, so it's pretty scummy business practices..."

> "Wow this app has become unusable... 3 free expense entries per day and 3 more with 10 seconds ads. This has got to be the most desperate monetization attempt I've seen."

> "I would honestly prefer an ad every few minutes to being blocked out of the app after 4 expenses."

## 3. Unreasonable Pricing Model (Subscription vs. Utility)
**Explanation:** There is a consensus that the value proposition of a "glorified calculator" does not justify a recurring subscription model (~$40-$50/year). Users are willing to pay, but they want a "one-time purchase" or a "trip pass," not a SaaS subscription for an app used sporadically.

**Excerpts:**
> "There's no justification for an annual 36 fee for what this app offers."

> "I use splitwise 1-2 times a year I have to pay each time, not going to support that nonsense."

> "If this app was a one-off payment, I would do it, but a monthly subscription is not worth it."

> "Charge me $20 for unlimited transactions forever and it's a done deal. Got to go look elsewhere."

## 4. Feature Stripping & Paywalling
**Explanation:** Long-time users feel betrayed because features that were previously free (like receipt scanning, charts, and unrestricted expense entry) have been moved behind a paywall. This is often described as "enshittification."

**Excerpts:**
> "developers deliberately enshittified their app and removed features to make them available only to paid subscribers."

> "A few months ago, I noticed I couldn't add receipts. Now I can't even add more than a few expenses. Why is splitwise monetizing something that has been perfect...?"

> "If you release an app, never take away the base features or hide them behind a pay wall. Let us have the app you gave us, and add features that make upgrading optional."

## 5. Core Utility & "Used to Be" Love
**Explanation:** Despite the negativity, the reviews reveal why the app was successful: it solved a real problem (awkward money splitting) elegantly. Users *want* to love the app, which drives their frustration.

**Excerpts:**
> "Initially, one of the best apps out there for financing group trips."

> "Loved it at first, and it'd be 5 stars if it was worth using but the costs are out of this world."

> "This app has the functionality to track a trip, I've loved using it for years now. But recently, they have gone downhill..."
