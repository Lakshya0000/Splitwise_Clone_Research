**Thumbs Up:** 483 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Ruined the app with their horrible decision of implementing a 3 transaction per day limit with an annoying 10 second wait between each. I'm hoping I can find an alternative to what used to be a perfect app. I'm not against paying for it, but making the free tier useless and also having an expensive subscription model instead of a one time payment is a surefire way of shooting yourself in the foot.

**Thumbs Up:** 467 | **Rating:** 1/5

> I had been a fan of splitwise as it was very user-friendly. But now they have allowed only 3 expense entries per day (that too with 10 secs ad in between) is just ridiculous. If they wanted income via a subscription model, then they should have worked on providing additional features with it and the basic version should have been free and it is when there are similar apps free of cost. Also they don't have any nominal or lifetime subscription and the monthly/yearly ones are very high.

**Thumbs Up:** 392 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Used to love Splitwise when it was free. You now have to pay to get the "Pro" edition and be able to put in unlimited payments. It is SO inconvenient when on a trip (3 payments a day - really???). You saw green, and because of corporate greed, you ruined what was once an amazing app to use with friends when in vacation. To heck with you. I'm moving to Splid.

**Thumbs Up:** 389 | **Rating:** 1/5

> There was no other app in comparison with splitwise for spitting bills and expenses, however the recent changes done by them that you can only enter 2 expenses at a time makes this app really useless for all of us. Giving extra features with pro subscription is understood but not allowing users to use it for it's core function is really not acceptable. I hope they go ahead and bring back the older version, untill then switching to other app 🙁

**Thumbs Up:** 379 | **Rating:** 1/5

> I have been a user of splitwise for around a decade. I understand every business needs to make money but putting a limit on the number of expenses that can be added shows how little they care about their customers. They could charge their customers premium for premium services but to totally prevent the customer from doing the most basic function is totally uncalled for.

**Thumbs Up:** 337 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Asking for money after the latest update. The apps become unusable. Can only record 3 transactions a day. Also annoyed by forced ad to be watched. Time to find other similar apps. I have been using this for over a decade. But with everything restricted after the update and only few features available on the free version, i am gonna switch to another one for sure.

**Thumbs Up:** 315 | **Rating:** 1/5

> I've been using Splitwise since 7-8 years. I used it to track all my expenses but the recent feature to not allow adding new expenses after certain limit is terrible. I understand the developers need to generate revenue but this is not the way. the subscription amount is too high for my basic purpose, you can always keep high end features for those who are interested.

**Thumbs Up:** 299 | **Rating:** 1/5

> I have been using this app for over a decade, but,now it's just constant pop up for buying pro. while adding new expenses ,I have to wait for pop up for 10s. then, it restricts me with maximum expenses added for the day. So, now I have to wait till tomorrow for adding more expenses. It's so annoying. I am definitely gonna switch to alternate app.

## Review #9
**Thumbs Up:** 289 | **Rating:** 1/5

> It was amazing app to manage group expenses. I would've put up with their decision to show ads for adding multiple transactions. But they're beeing too greedy by adding per day transaction limits. And the recurring payment option for upgrading to pro is too high for what it does, yes there are some added features with pro, but some of us just need more transactions per day.

## Review #10
**Thumbs Up:** 283 | **Rating:** 2/5

> Splitwise's recent update is exactly how a brand can kill off its customer base. I've long used Splitwise, and recommended it to many, but the limited daily entries (and the annoying long ads in between) have made it unusable. I understand that companies need to monetise their offerings for revenue. But doing so at the expense of basic features is a decision that'll cost them many users. I'll suggest at least including 10 daily entries and the basic functionalities in the free version.

**Thumbs Up:** 264 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Used to love the App for what it offers, but off late it has become really irritating to ask to take Pro desperately. It was offering some Features for it made sence. But now it is stooping soo low that it's become unusable. Having a limit of being able to enter only 4 Transactions per day 🤔🤔. Add some feature for the value. Otherwise there are better alternatives. Don't assume that you are irreplaceable.

## Review #12
**Thumbs Up:** 257 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Been using splitwise for years but forcing users to watch a 10 second ad everytime they want to add an expense is ridiculous. The pro upgrade is crazy expensive for what it offers ($5/mo). I'd be willing to make a one time purchase for an ad free option. The hunt for a replacement app starts today. I don't need much. Just add expenses and split it between a group.

## Review #13
**Thumbs Up:** 256 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Splitwise used to be a highly useful app, but it has sadly lost its credibility now. What was once a seamless experience has become frustrating. The app now lacks even the most basic features and feels like a waste of time. Despite not having ads to show, it disrupts the flow with unnecessary "ad breaks" for each expense entry. To make things worse, there's now a limit of only 4 entries per day. Also no search options. Overall, it's a very disappointing and frustrating experience.

**Thumbs Up:** 230 | **Rating:** 1/5

> I've used this app for many years but recently it's now forcing full screen ads for the premium version that you have to wait to dismiss, and worst of all they limit the number of expenses you can add in a day. Terrible. It's a shame as it's been an incredible app for years. Time to find an alternative. Would accept a small one off fee to bring back the normal basic app with number of entries per day and zero ads, but the pro tier is too much when I don't need/want the other features.

## Review #15
**Thumbs Up:** 230 | **Rating:** 1/5

> I used to like this app a lot, but it has gone downhill recently. It used to let me record as many expenses as I wanted, but now it asks me to upgrade to pro after only three entries. The subscription fee is too high for what it offers. I don't need all the fancy features, I just want a simple and reliable app to track my spending. This app has become money minded and lost its original value.

## Review #16
**Thumbs Up:** 219 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Used to be great app, but now it's useless. I have been using it for many years, but recently they just pushed people away. First, they added a 10seconds waiting time before adding any expenses.. Okay, annoying, but fair enough, it's free. Then, they added a daily limit of expenses that you can insert in the app. So it's basically useless now. Who wants to pay a monthly fee to just track the bills? Tons of alternative for free. Bye bye Splitwise.

## Review #17
**Thumbs Up:** 196 | **Rating:** 1/5

> I've been using Splitwise since 2018 and have always appreciated its simplicity and utility. However, the recent update for basic users is incredibly disappointing. Adding an ad just to input a transaction and limiting users to only 4 transactions per day is a terrible move. This app used to make splitting expenses hassle-free, but now it feels like a money grab. If you're going to push people toward paid plans, at least keep basic functionality intact. Uninstalling immediately. Terrible update

## Review #18
**Thumbs Up:** 187 | **Rating:** 1/5

> The recent changes to the Splitwise app are highly disappointing. The restriction of adding only three transactions per day and the push to purchase the pro version for this basic functionality is a significant drawback. It's frustrating when you were used to a more user-friendly experience. I hope they reconsider these changes in the future.

## Review #19
**Thumbs Up:** 182 | **Rating:** 2/5

> Was a pretty great app for tracking. Emphasis on WAS. Now you can only add a handful of expenses before they lock you out and require their "Pro" subscription. They also make you wait a 10 second timer before adding each expense unless you have "Pro". This isn't how it was before, so it's pretty scummy business practices to change it to be predatory like this, after all this time using it. Time to look for alternative apps.

## Review #20
**Thumbs Up:** 178 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Was previously a fantastic app, however since they capped the number of expenses you may enter to 3 per day, not so much. Of course, I can pay £30 for the premium version, but then my partner likewise has to pay. And thats a subscription, not a one of cost. All so that we may enter more than 3 items per day (we have no use for any of the other features provided). Guess we will go back to manual calculations! To sum up, was a brilliant app before, now it's not really worth bothering with.

## Review #21
**Thumbs Up:** 177 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Previously 5 stars. Update: Dec 13th, 2023 They have limited the number of expenses that can be inputted to 3/day. As I budget monthly, it's is very inconvenient when I need to enter over 20 expenses at once. I've been using this service for almost 3 years and was not notified of this change. I will be switching to a different app or making my own spreadsheet. It's upsetting to lose so many years of transaction history so I am leaving a 1 star review.

---
## Review #22
**Thumbs Up:** 175 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Used to be great, but now they're making it impossible to use on the free tier. First they started making us waiting ten seconds between entries. Now I'm being told I have to wait a full day before I can finish entering my expenses. Absolutely ridiculous. I have no problem with the app being supported by ads, and I have no problem with them adding additional paid tiers with extra features. But to take the most basic, essential functionality away from the free tier is inexcusable greed.

---
## Review #23
**Thumbs Up:** 172 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Was invited by a pro user who pays for the app before a trip. I told them it would be easier to just settle up at the end and they were insistent this was an easier, better, fairer system. I got together all the things I paid for and started adding them and got locked out after 4 entries. A horrible first experience for an app that's a good idea. Everyone has to pay for premium for this to be worthwhile. Not even a trial to see if it works for you, just makes more work for you. Zero Stars.

## Review #24
**Thumbs Up:** 169 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Splitwise has been a staple on my phone for years. I am always trying to get friends and family to use it -- and have sung its praises while doing so. Now it requires a monthly/annual subscription fee for the most basic of functions. It's truly diabolical how significantly they limit the free usage, it's legitimately unusable. They aren't even trying. If it was a one-time fee, I would pay it with minimal grumbling, it is a good app, but a subscription service is frankly absurd. Bye forever.

---
## Review #25
**Thumbs Up:** 167 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Splitwise was a convenient way to keep track of expenses with various groups. Several features were behind the paid version. The core functionality is simple but functional. The app has now moved to a largely unusable paid-only model which limits free users to tiny amounts. I would be willing to pay for better functionality or the service, but the monthly subscription model is expensive for the features. I will be looking for an alternative.

---
## Review #26
**Thumbs Up:** 166 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Used to be such an amazing app, it was simple but effective. Now, they limit the number of transactions you can add on there if you're a free user. For how essential of an app this used to be, I wouldn't have minded a 1-time unlock fee to get access to unlimited transactions. The subscription gives you access to a whole bunch of (in my opinion) junk. No one was subscribing before and no one still is. Charge me $20 for unlimited transactions forever and it's a done deal. Got to go look elsewhere.

## Review #27
**Thumbs Up:** 161 | **Rating:** 1/5

> It was an amazing app, have been using it for over two years to split costs of travels, with different currencies / groups etc, never an issue and I would have definitely recommended. Now they decided to set a daily limit of entries, firstly letting you add one after waiting 10 seconds and then not at all until the next day.. unless you subscribe. It is an extremely sad and disappointing marketing move. We can just use a different app instead of paying you for this ridicolous change.

---
## Review #28
**Thumbs Up:** 147 | **Rating:** 1/5

> The app used to be great. But in the last few days, they added a very harsh expense limit (only 3 a day??) AND timers to add expenses for non-pro users. I get that you have to monetise, but restraining previously free and unlimited functionality is a pretty poor choice. Why not just introduce ads? Look for an alternative, can't recommend it in its current state.

---
## Review #29
**Thumbs Up:** 143 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Absolutely terrible. Been using this app for a while now and was about to shift to the pro version then came across a daily expense limit that they recently introduced. It let's me input just 3 expenses a day! The fact that made their free experience so terrible just to shift people to the paid version is not the way to go if you want to build good will. Quite a terrible decision on the teams part. I can get behind a limit of 20 or 30, but 3!?!? That's unacceptable

---
## Review #30
**Thumbs Up:** 142 | **Rating:** 1/5

> The pro subscription existed for sometime and offered many in depth features but the basic functionality of the app remained free. But everything changed when the greedy peeps at Splitwise decided they need a new Lamborghini. Now the app is so annoying that is forces you buy the subscription. Could have made it a one time purchase but nooo! They want your money monthly. Tell you what, not paying subscription, logging my expenses in Excel and updating Splitwise everyday... Downfall of a great app

## Review #31
**Thumbs Up:** 139 | **Rating:** 1/5

> I've used this app for several years for it's basic expense splitting function. It used to be a wonderful resource for friends, roommate etc to keep track of shared costs. With their new push to get people to use the paid version I've lost interest and will find a new app. You only get two free transactions a day and you have to watch a ten second ad in order to post. There was no warning for this change at all. Such a shame to lose another good service.

---
## Review #32
**Thumbs Up:** 137 | **Rating:** 1/5

> The latest update is annoying and frustrating to the utmost level. There is only option to add 3 expenses a day which is utter nonsense. And every addition forces you to watch ad. If I have to watch ad I would rather watch the one I am forced to watch in YouTube and not waste my time here. It is asking for money, the yearly package amount is equal to something I can rather use to get an ott subscription. This used to be an app that used to make life convenient....What a huge disappointment.

## Review #33
**Thumbs Up:** 136 | **Rating:** 1/5

> We've been using splitwise to track household expenses for 7 years, but that ends today. I can understand the interstitial ad for splitwise pro when the app starts—it's annoying but you can skip it. But there's now a TEN SECOND FORCED INTERSTITIAL for it on EVERY EXPENSE you input. I don't appreciate having my time wasted. The app has always been buggy and clunky, and is simply not worth $5 a month. $1/mo or $10/year would be more reasonable.

---
## Review #34
**Thumbs Up:** 129 | **Rating:** 1/5

> I have used this app for a long time and it was great, until the developer's greed kicked in. Now, there is a daily entry limit and ads kick in wanting you to upgrade to Pro, that you cannot skip for 10 seconds. Their asking price is much too expensive for this type of app. I understand wanting to cash in on hard work, but $0.99/mo, $9.99/yr, or maybe a one time $29.99 fee would be much more reasonable and likely would've been an instant upgrade for me. But now, I'll be looking for a new app.

## Review #35
**Thumbs Up:** 126 | **Rating:** 1/5

> One star so that they listen. App was great. Roomies, friends, and I were happy. I recommended this app to everyone. But paying for adding more than 3 expenses?! $40 a year is just overpriced. I was fine with other features being moved to pro. But this is too much. I really only need the ability to add expenses, which I'd be willing to pay for a reasonable price🙃. Starting my look for another app.

## Review #36
**Thumbs Up:** 125 | **Rating:** 1/5

> DON'T DOWNLOAD IT. I've been using Splitwise since 2016. With their recent changes to the free version, the DAILY LIMIT for entering expenses is FOUR! For my own sanity, I will only work on bill expenses max twice/mo. To remove the max limitation (and now ads), you'll need to purchase their recurring subscription. I could've dealt with the addition of ads for using the free version. However, that max daily limit is a great way to show other businesses how to lose loyal customers quickly.

---
## Review #37
**Thumbs Up:** 125 | **Rating:** 1/5

> The pay wall (pay limit) to add upto 3 expenses is definitely a deal breaker. The product has been used massively by the people but it seems that they are being forced to buy the Pro plan. Although the price point is not so high on an individual basis, however, with a price sensitive user base "splitwise alternative" keyword seems to be on surge on the search. Good luck to Splitwise, I hope they reflect on this decision, they are more ways to get users to Pro without forcing them.

---
## Review #38
**Thumbs Up:** 123 | **Rating:** 1/5

> No longer free, and $5/mo is unreasonably pricey for the service offered, especially considering every member of the group must have their own subscription. It still works like it always has, but only with the required subscription. Because Splitwise has been good and free (with ads) for so long, there hasn't been many competitors. That's changing, and I strongly suggest considering an alternative before starting your next Splitwise group.

---
## Review #39
**Thumbs Up:** 123 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Recent Changes that are added, limiting the transactions that can be added to 3 per day and 10 second ads pushing people towards using Pro is very detrimental towards the user experience. They made it unusable for free users and the pro doesn't have any one-time payment option but a subscription which is greedy for such a basic app. Switching to other alternatives now.

---
## Review #40
**Thumbs Up:** 122 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Ads were started that delayed our addition of new transactions. Now, I have to wait a full day to add new transactions or else buy subscription. This is absurd. I ll find a new app to switch. The subscription is really high. If it was a one time fee, I would have tried to buy it. But current model is absurd.

---
## Review #41
**Thumbs Up:** 119 | **Rating:** 1/5

> The new expense limit of 4 and ads are indeed ridiculous. I actually did sign up for the paid subscription for a month before this change and the features associated with it were not useful, which is probably why they chose to make the app worse. And the timing of right around the holidays (when people will be traveling and buying gifts) is extremely obnoxious. I'll be switching apps and only using splitwise as a last resort if I can't get my current roommate to switch.

**Thumbs Up:** 118 | **Rating:** 1/5

> I've been using the app for a very long time and it was doing a wonderful job. I even signed up for the Pro version and, when I saw the quality of what I got, I cancelled it immediately. Now they've introduced daily expense limit to the free version, and it's 3!! Meaning, you can only add 3 expenses per day, that's it!! If this doesn't change, I'll be leaving the app pretty soon. There are other apps that do the same job (if not a better one, even) for free.

**Thumbs Up:** 116 | **Rating:** 1/5

> What a great app! We used Splitwise for almost every holiday trip and even created a group for our shared groceries at home. It's been years that I used this app and was amazed of the simplicity and great user experience. But now, without any warning, I get stopped after entering 3 expenses every day with a note that I should upgrade to PRO. It justy instantly killed my user experience. After all this time it seems that I have to look for alternatives..

## Review #44
**Thumbs Up:** 115 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Used to be a great app. Been using it over a decade till recently they started to monetize the free tier. First strike was 10 seconds wait, seconds strike was no more than 2 or 3 entries from app. But I could still use their site to add expenses. With third strike they blocked addition everywhere. I don't mind watching a 10 sec ad. One can live with ads, e.g. YouTube. I don't mind paying one time fee but $5 a month 😱. Totally stopping the main action is very aggressive Bye bye splitwise. RIP.

## Review #45
**Thumbs Up:** 113 | **Rating:** 1/5

> I have been using this App for over 10 years now. Yes, I had been using the free version. It's completely fine to monetize the app, but to limit the number of expenses and a time delay for adding the expenses in the free version to essentially force the users to upgrade to PRO is a very bad move. Reduce the monthly price to <2$ and I'll subscribe. Keep making it difficult to use the free version and I'll gladly uninstall and find an alternative.

## Review #46
**Thumbs Up:** 112 | **Rating:** 2/5

> The most basic feature of adding transactios to a group has been made unavailable because the makers are getting a bit too greedy. Premium feature is too expensive for what it offers. Most people just use splitwise as a basic calculator to split purchases. This can also be done with some effort on a simple phone calculator. Hence it doesn't make sense to pay so much for premium version. And now i cannot even add more than 5-6 transactions in a day. This is really weirs.

## Review #47
**Thumbs Up:** 111 | **Rating:** 1/5

> I have been using Splitwise for years now. The recent update that adds 10 sec ads after adding each expense and only able to add 4 expense per day is ridiculous. I am not willing to pay for a subscription model, one time charge would have been fine. However restricting the basic features which have been available for years is even more ridiculous. I may need to start looking for an alternative app and ask my friends to switch over as well.

## Review #48
**Thumbs Up:** 111 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Like everybody else reviewing this recently, it was a great app and I used it mainly when tracing with my partner and our friends. But the daily limit of only 3 expenses is really unfair to everyone who's been using this over the years. I'm sure we'd all pay a small one off fee to continue using as it was, but the pro version isn't worth the money for the features you get, so I doubt anyone is actually purchasing it. Uninstalling and looking for an alternative. Shame on the developers.

## Review #49
**Thumbs Up:** 110 | **Rating:** 1/5

> Used this app for years, and even occassionly would buy a month of the pro version every couple of months. Now the free version is completely unusable due to standard features going behind paywalls (seriously, only 3 tx per month?). The pro is absurdly expensive considering all the alternatives and the lack of of market differentiation. Goodbye Splitwise, we had a good run.

## Review #50
**Thumbs Up:** 106 | **Rating:** 1/5

> I haven't opened the app in about a week, but I opened it today to add our expenses from the last 4 days. For every expense, I had a full 10 second ad for splitwise pro ($40 USD a year mind you), and after about 5 items, I was unable to add any more for the day. I am uninstalling right now. You can take your forced subscription model bull, and shove it. I'd rather use a Google spreadsheet.
