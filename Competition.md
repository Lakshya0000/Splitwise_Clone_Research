# Competitive Analysis: Splitwise Alternatives

This document summarizes the competitive landscape for Splitwise, focusing on alternatives mentioned by users who are migrating away due to recent monetization changes.

## Top Competitors Mentioned by Users

Based on user reviews, the primary alternatives users are switching to include:

1.  **Tricount:** Most frequently mentioned.
2.  **Splid:** Praised for its simplicity and lack of a sign-up requirement.
3.  **Settle Up:** Often cited as a powerful and feature-rich alternative.
4.  **Sesterce & Others:** Mentioned less frequently, but noted for favorable pricing.

## Competitor Overview

### 1. Tricount

*   **Why Users Switch:** Overwhelmingly cited as the main reason for switching from Splitwise is that Tricount offers a similar core functionality **for free**. Users perceive it as "Splitwise before it got greedy."
*   **Monetization:** Primarily free. Offers a "Premium" version to remove ads and unlock features like statistics. Users seem more accepting of this model.
*   **Key Differentiator:** Its widespread adoption as a straightforward, free, and no-frills alternative makes it a direct threat to Splitwise's former free user base.

### 2. Splid

*   **Why Users Switch:** Users love Splid for its **simplicity and the lack of a sign-up requirement**. It allows for quick group creation and expense tracking without forcing all participants to create an account, which is a major advantage for temporary groups.
*   **Monetization:** Mostly free and **ad-free** in its core experience. Offers one-time purchases for specific features like Excel export or managing more groups.
*   **Key Differentiator:** The "no login required" aspect significantly reduces friction for new users and temporary groups, making it highly appealing for casual use.

### 3. Settle Up

*   **Why Users Switch:** Users find Settle Up to be a more powerful and feature-rich alternative with a more flexible and user-friendly pricing model.
*   **Monetization:** Offers a freemium model. A key feature is the **one-time "Group Premium" purchase**, which unlocks all premium features for a specific group (e.g., a trip) and can be shared/split among group members. This directly addresses Splitwise's "everyone must subscribe" problem.
*   **Key Differentiator:** The innovative "Group Premium" pricing model aligns perfectly with the sporadic, group-centric use case of expense-splitting apps, making it a strong alternative for users who want premium features without individual recurring subscriptions.

### 4. Other Mentions

*   **Sesterce:** Noted for its reasonable pricing model.
*   **Fairshare, Spliit, Splitmyexpenses, Cashew:** Mentioned as alternatives, but with less detail in the reviews.
*   **Manual Methods:** Many users state they will revert to **Google Sheets (Excel)** or even pen and paper, highlighting their extreme dissatisfaction with Splitwise's current model.

## Summary of Competitive Landscape

The competitive landscape indicates a strong user preference for either completely free solutions (Tricount, Splid) or those with more flexible, one-time payment options (Settle Up's Group Premium). The primary drivers for switching are:

*   **Cost:** Splitwise's high recurring subscription fee for basic functionality.
*   **Friction:** Daily expense limits and forced 10-second ads in the free tier.
*   **Usability:** Requirement for all group members to have paid subscriptions, which creates social friction.
*   **Lack of Value:** The perception that Splitwise's Pro features don't justify its high recurring cost, especially for infrequent users.

These competitors are successfully capturing dissatisfied Splitwise users by offering either a truly free experience for core features or a more palatable monetization strategy.
