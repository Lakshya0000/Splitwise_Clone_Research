It would be greater if it's not only for splitting purpose but also to manage smb's money/financial, so all will be in one app. Anw, when i try it, there some things need u to develop:  1. I couldn't find a way to detail the payments. E.g. when we go to restaurant w/ our friends, each of us will order different menu n somebody will pay it all first. There's no detail n tax feature for this. I have to use my excel first to break it down per member, add the tax at the end of my recap then input the final number into ur app. It would be great if I can break it down (to keep its fairness), add the tax n other extra cost that needs to be split or not in ur app.  2. As i mentioned before, there're some events that some items are split and some are not. If i could break it down which one that needs to be split and which one is not in 1 transaction that's even more cool. E.g. me n my friend order some foods with goFood (delivery service) and i'm the one who pay it all first. Each of us will pay our meals but the cost of goFood will be split equally. It's not apply for the delivery cost only but perhaps in other situation i.e. driver's meal when we rent a car together n others (so it should be a free txt with a feature on/off split feature).   3. How about with this case. I bought a souvenir through my friend. I gave him some extra money (since we don't know the price is). This case, should be applicable to ur app. I could add a transaction with a detail the money that i gave to him n he also could add the proof and input the real cost and ur app will recap it as my balance and he will know how much the change that needs to be given to me.   So ur app is not only for splitting purpose with some great features, but also smb's financial recap. Starting from one's expenses, incomes n financial plan.   Hope u will make it more compact. Definitely Will keep your app in my phone. Thanks! \ud83d\udc98",

Hi guys got your reply mentioning that the app is designed to edit the expenses within a group.  This is completely a developer point of view and he is right in his way. He achieved his/her requirements.  Consider an example of one group member expended 10000 and shared with group,and second person has edited the same expense to 1000 and saves it.The loss would be in 1000's.  As a user of your app I expect no dicrepencies in the trasactions.  If each user has a time n patience to look into the activity tab each and every time I think your app is of no use to him since he can well maintain a written record and has a calculator too.

Cash pooling concept: To add a feature wherein a Cash pool is created by contributions from members - the Administrator of the Cash pool can then do payouts thru the pool collection.  2. To introduce link to popular cashless payment channels so that settlements and transfers are all done within the App.  3. Introduce unequal contributions from a set of members to pay for service/s distributed amongst a different set of members unequally. Currently only the second part is supported. We found on a recent outing if say three people paid up a hotel bill for say 7 members that included these three - we had to create three separate entries.  4. Introduce a what-if analysis for settlements so that one can check how the overall settlement looks if certain transfers amongst members or in and out of cash pool were effected. Typically we faced a problem as some members found it easier to settle amongst a few of their friends but not everyone (there are always groups amongst groups).  5. Introduce per capita Group common expenses so that at termination each member can analyse how much the whole trip / event cost and how much this member under/over spent for himself/herself. For example - some flew vs most took train. Or some spent a lot on alochol but most abstained.",
